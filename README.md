# BookStore

*This is simple bookstore web app restful api, using NodeJs Express and Mongodb with AngularJs. I am new to the javascript stack so*
*basically this  project is just to get me started with this stack. I'll Appreciate it if you could suggest soultion for*
*the current issue.*

**Currently:** *Building a detail book page*
**Current Issue:**
 *Facing Problem to navigate to the detail book page somehow I*
 *receive weird templateUrl after Pressing The Detail View Button.*

## To Do Later:
* Add Page To Add Books
* Delete Books

### Next:
* Build Authentication, Using JSON web token authentication 
* Login with FaceBook, Google , By using Passport
* Add Book in a user List to be in the reading list
* Comments on each book with a given review by users
* Show the over all rate of each book once entering the book details page
* Build Native Front End to the samrphones using React Native for both Android and IOS
* Figured out the server hoster and configration, AppEngine, Azure, AWS, Heroku
